# Truffle Suite

This module integrates the Truffle Suite for smart contract development, testing, deployment, and management.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Development**: Write smart contracts using Solidity or other supported languages.
- **Smart Contract Testing**: Write and run unit tests to ensure the correctness of smart contracts.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy smart contracts to the Ethereum test network or mainnet.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Interact with deployed smart contracts by calling their methods.
- **Network Management**: Configure and manage Ethereum networks, including local development networks and remote networks.

## Usage

```javascript
const truffleSuite = require('web3-defi-mony/lib/smartcontracts/TruffleSuite');

// Compile a smart contract
const contractSource = '/* Solidity contract source code */';
const compiledContract = await truffleSuite.compileContract(contractSource);

// Deploy a smart contract
const fromAddress = '0x...'; // The Ethereum address of the deployer
const deployedContractAddress = await truffleSuite.deployContract(compiledContract, fromAddress);

// Interact with a smart contract
const abi = compiledContract.abi;
const methodName = 'someMethod';
const methodArgs = [/* Method arguments */];
const result = await truffleSuite.callContractMethod(deployedContractAddress, abi, methodName, methodArgs);
console.log(`Method result: ${result}`);
